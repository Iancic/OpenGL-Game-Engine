# OpenGL Game Engine

Custom game engine built to leverage the performace of C++, while integrating ImGui and Lua to allow designers to easily iterate on a custom engine project.

Purpose of the engine's is to develop Cosmoboros, a roguelike game about spaceworms and infinite worlds, while also serving as a learning opportunity focused on engine development, scripting, rendering pipelines and data oriented design using ECS and ENTT.

### Technology Stack:
- SDL: windowing and input
- OpenGL: rendering
- ENTT: ecs
- ImGui: engine editor
- Sol: Lua bindings for scripting
- Fmod: audio
- Box2D: physics
- GLM: maths
- YAML: serialization
